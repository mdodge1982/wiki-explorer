# Wiki Meta Explorer

## Summary
This is my implementation of the exercise described here: https://github.com/twoporeguys/ui-engineering-test/blob/wiki-meta-explorer/README.md

## Notes
- Styling inspired by https://www.wikipedia.org
- React for rendering
- Redux for state
- Jest for unit testing
- The projects and pages aren't fully alphabetical, but that's probably better handled by the back-end
- When the user selects a project or page, the app automatically subscribes to updates, then unsubscribes on deselect (let me know if the user should be able to manually subscribe/unsubscribe)
- Thanks for the opportunity, this was a fun project!
