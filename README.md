## Notes
- Styling inspired by https://www.wikipedia.org
- React for rendering
- Redux for state
- Jest for unit testing
- I thought about fixing the alphabetical sort, but then decided it's better handled by the back end :)
- The app automatically subscribes/unsubscribes to updates when the user selects/deselects a project or page
- Thanks for the opportunity, this was a fun project!
